# Minigames

These are small games coded for fun. Below lists some things I have learnt from coding
each game, from recent to least:

**[tictactoe](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/tictactoe.c)** (04/23/2019) 
- Developed an more efficient algorithm to find move wins. (in comparison to connect 4)
- Features 3 levels of AI.
	- Learnt and incorporated minimax algoithm in Level 3 AI.
  
**[hangman](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/hangman.c)** - guess the word picked! (04/19/2019):
- This was the first program I made without using a IDE. Learnt command line basics.
- First time using 2D arrays.

**[fastclick](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/fastclick.c)**- how many times can you press enter in 5 seconds? (04/16/2019):
- Learnt how to use time.h functions, such as clock().

**[connectfour](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/connect4.c)**- get 4 in a row diagonally, vertically, and horizontaly. 2 player support (04/16/2019):
- Mainly culmination of what I learnt in CS136. 
- Learnt how to randomly generate numbers with rand().
- Includes malloced memory, dealing with overflows.
- Features fun extras such as a naming and piece picking system, system deciding who goes first.
