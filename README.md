# Minigames

These are small games coded for fun. Below lists some things I have learnt from coding
each game, from recent to least:

**[pokemon battle simulator](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/Pokemon_Battle_Simulator.py)** - battle another generation one starter pokemon! (04/05/2020)
- First project done with Python, features OOP.

**[tictactoe](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/tictactoe.c)** - play tictactoe with a friend or a bot!(04/23/2019) 
- Features 3 levels of AI.
	- Learnt and incorporated minimax algoithm with Alpha-beta pruning for Level 3 AI. A search tree with all possible moves in a 	position is produced. Alpha-beta pruning is used to eliminate nodes that produce a worse move than a previously examined move, to increase search efficency. 
  
**[hangman](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/hangman.c)** - guess the word picked! (04/19/2019):

**[fastclick](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/fastclick.c)** - how many times can you press enter in 5 seconds? (04/16/2019):
- Learnt how to use time.h functions, such as clock().

**[connectfour](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Minigames/blob/master/connect4.c)** - get 4 in a row diagonally, vertically, and horizontaly. 2 player support (04/16/2019):
- Cumulation of concepts learnt in CS136, such as dealing with overflows and pointers.
- Features fun extras such as a naming and piece picking system, system deciding who goes first.
